- AS AN avid traveler
- I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
- SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

- GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
- WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
- THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
- WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
- THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their = totals are updated
